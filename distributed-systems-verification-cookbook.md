# Distributed Systems Verification Cookbook

## Introduction

> Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.  
> [~knuth](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/p.vanemdeboas/knuthnote.pdf)

In program logic, runtime failure is a function returning a non-zero integer or throwing an exception. In operating systems, it's typically indicated by a process returning a non-zero exit code. There are difficulties with relying on these solely for the purposes of verification, as they presume the program and environment to be [**deterministic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_Turing_machine) **\(reproducible\),** [**stateless**](https://wiki.c2.com/?ImmutableObject) **\(repeatable\),** and [**decidable**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem) **\(computable\)**.

This is a functional cookbook of patterns I have found generally useful for verifying the correctness of software comprising **non-deterministic**, **stateful**, and **undecidable** distributed systems. Implementations are usually provided in **bash** and are intended to work on **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows** \(via e.g. [**cygwin**](https://www.cygwin.com/), [**WSL**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)\). Examples use [**MPICH 3.3.2**](https://www.mpich.org/static/downloads/3.3.2/) with the [**Hydra process manager**](https://wiki.mpich.org/mpich/index.php/Using_the_Hydra_Process_Manager) ****running on **Ubuntu 20.04**.

```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential mpich
VER=$(mpichversion | awk 'NR==1{print $3}')  # 3.3.2
wget https://www.mpich.org/static/downloads/$VER/mpich-$VER.tar.gz
tar xf mpich-$VER.tar.gz
cd mpich-$VER/test/mpi
./configure MPICC=$(which mpicc) MPICXX=$(which mpicxx)
make -j
```

## Undecidable Programs

> Testing can be used very effectively to show the presence of bugs but never to show their absence.  
> [~EWD](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD303.html)

In the simplest case, failure is **decidable** \(and therefore **finite**\). Given a **program** $$k \in K$$ and ****a **size** \(number of [**ranks**](https://www.mpich.org/static/docs/v3.3/www3/MPI_Comm_rank.html)\) $$n \in \Bbb{N}$$, we can generically express a **program result** as $$P(k, n)$$.

$$
\text{$\forall (k,n) \in (K, \Bbb{N}) : P(k,n) \in
\begin{cases}
\text{$x : x \in \Bbb{Z}$ and $0 \leq x \lt 2^8$},  & \text{POSIX} \\
\text{$x : x \in \Bbb{Z}$ and $0 \leq x \lt 2^{32}$},  & \text{Windows} \\
x : \text{typeof}(x) \in \{\text{char}, \text{int}, ...\} & \text{C} \\
\text{...}
\end{cases}
$}
$$

Any **integral** program result $$p \in \Bbb{Z}$$ can be expressed as a binary \(two-choice\) **test result** $$T_\text{rc}(p)$$ with a simple function.

$$
\forall p \in \Bbb{Z}, T_\text{rc}(p) =
\begin{cases}
\text{PASS}, & p = 0 \\
\text{FAIL}, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Let's implement $$T_\text{rc} \circ P$$in a bash script.

{% code title="test.sh" %}
```bash
set -u

readonly n=$1
shift

readonly E_PASS=0
readonly E_FAIL=1
e() {
    case "$1" in
      $E_PASS) echo E_PASS ;;
      $E_FAIL) echo E_FAIL ;;
    esac
}

mpiexec.hydra -n $n "${@}"
rc=$?
case "$rc" in
  0) ret=$E_PASS ;;
  *) ret=$E_FAIL ;;
esac

echo "$(e $ret) ($ret)"
```
{% endcode %}

We can run the `basic/self` test with one rank and expect it to pass.

Undecidable programs require special handling. `basic/srtest` requires at least two ranks to run, and it will **hang indefinitely** if launched with only one rank.

Programs that can hang indefinitely have **unbounded runtime** and are not decidable.

### Method: Timeouts

We can make such programs decidable by bounding their runtime with a **timeout** function, however this introduces a new parameter $$s$$ \(duration\) and function $$S$$ \(elapse\) into our model.

$$
\text{$\forall (s,k,n) \in (\Bbb{N}, K, \Bbb{N}): P_\text{timeout}(s,k,n) =
\begin{cases}
P(k,n), & S(k,n) \lt s \\
\text{TIMEOUT}, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$}
$$

We can use `timeout` from [**GNU coreutils**](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/) to detect and handle this new type of failure with `test.sh`.

We can imagine that there must be correct and even optimal values of $$s$$ for every decidable $$(k,n)$$ pair. Setting $$s$$ too low **increases the probability of false positives**.

Using a different $$k$$ with a given $$s$$ can likewise affect the result. A valid value for $$s$$ must therefore be any value for which $$P_\text{timeout}(s,k,n) \ne \text{TIMEOUT}$$ for decidable inputs $$(k,n)$$, and the optimal is its minimum.

$$
S(k,n) = \{\text{$s : s \in \Bbb{Z}$ and $P_\text{timeout}(s,k,n) \ne \text{TIMEOUT}$}\} \\
s^\text{optimal}_{k,n} = \text{min}(S(k,n))
$$

Computing whether any given pair $$(k,n)$$ is decidable is not itself decidable, so **timeout thresholds are typically guessed** by the test author ahead of time**.**

In practice, timeouts frequently become a source of **nondeterminism** because of the inherent [**race conditions**](https://wiki.c2.com/?RaceCondition) ****in the runtime. How can they be improved?

### Method: Progress Tracking

Introducing a concept of **progress** allows us to compute valid values for $$s$$ based only on $$k$$ instead of $$(k,n)$$. This means that a **single timeout value** $$s$$ **can be used for all values of** $$n$$.

$$
S(k) = \{\text{$s : s \in \Bbb{Z}$ and $\forall n \in \Bbb{N}, P_\text{timeout}(s,k,n) \ne \text{TIMEOUT}$}\} \\
s^\text{optimal}_k = \text{min}(S(k))
$$

A simple way of instrumenting progress is with **standard I/O**. This program wraps `test.sh` and provides the $$\text{TIMEOUT}$$ test result if $$s$$ seconds of no output are seen.

{% code title="progress-stdin.sh" %}
```bash
set -e

tmp=$(mktemp -d)
trap 'rm -rf -- "$tmp"' EXIT
fifo=$tmp/fifo
mkfifo $fifo
timeout=$1
shift
last_updated=$(date +%s)
"${@}" > $fifo &
pid=$!
while IFS= read -t $timeout -r line; do
    echo "$line"
    last_updated=$(date +%s)
done < $fifo
if [ $(( $(date +%s) - $last_updated )) -ge $timeout ]; then
    echo E_TIMEOUT
    kill $pid
    wait -n
    exit 1
fi
```
{% endcode %}

For this particular program, $$s=5$$ provides fast results in all cases without any false positives.
